Functions

//=============================================================================
Functions are the fundamental building block of any applications in JavaScript.
Theyâ€™re how you build up layers of abstraction, mimicking classes,
information hiding, and modules. In TypeScript, while there are classes,
namespaces, and modules, functions still play the key role in describing
how to do things. TypeScript also adds some new capabilities to the standard
JavaScript functions to make them easier to work with.
